# An-intelligent-system-for-storytelling-from-images
This project investigates the interplay between images and textual 
narratives by developing an intelligent system capable of generating 
stories from visual inputs. The system integrates multiple approaches: 
a traditional deep learning pipeline using Convolutional Neural Networks 
(CNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), state-of-the-art 
transformer-based architectures such as BLIP, and a hybrid framework 
that leverages CLIP for visual understanding and GPT for creative text 
generation.
 Experiments were conducted using the Flickr8k dataset, which contains 
images paired with five descriptive captions each. The study evaluates the 
performance of different algorithms in terms of narrative quality, 
semantic richness, and contextual relevance.
 The findings aim to demonstrate the capabilities of modern multimodal 
learning models compared to traditional approaches, while highlighting 
their potential applications in educational and entertainment domains, 
particularly in generating child-friendly stories from images.
